"""
Bait Blocker - Makes hungry goriya block access to separate dungeon regions.

This module implements a partition-based approach to modify dungeon walls:
1. Find the hungry goriya room
2. Create two partitions (A and B) separated by the hungry goriya
3. Expand both partitions via flood-fill
4. Solidify all walls between the two partitions

This forces players to use bait to pass through the hungry goriya room to reach partition B.
